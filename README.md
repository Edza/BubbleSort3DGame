# BubbleSort3DGame
This was created together with a student as a learning project. Our first 3D application.

Its kind of a game. You control a ball and can interact with boxes. When two boxes are slected they can be exchanged. This exchange is animated.

There is a button the ball can be navigated to which causes all the boxes to sort themsevles in the order of their size using the bubble sort algorithm in 3D animation.
